# Contact Badges

Contact record pages for program-delivery organizations can get overwhelming. Organizations want to collect as much relevant information as they can about a donor, customer, or client, but still need the ability to have some information rise above the rest. Contact Badges adds visual highlights of related data to Contact record pages and offers quick-navigation to the source records.
