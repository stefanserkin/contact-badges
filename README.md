# Contact Badges

Contact record pages can get overwhelming. Organizations want to collect as much relevant information as they can about a donor, customer, or client, but still need the ability to have some information rise above the rest. Contact Badges adds visual highlights of related data to Contact record pages and offers quick navigation to related records.
